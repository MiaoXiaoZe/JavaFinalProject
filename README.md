Plan
We plan to design a budget book that allows the user to keep track of how much money they spend. It will have several features.
1. Spending summary
This will tells us our total monthly spending,todayâ€™s spending, our average daily spending, how much budget do we have, and the days left for the end of the month, We will create a circular progress bar to visualize our spending.
2. Record a spending
We can record the amount of money we spend, the category, date, and notes.
3. Spending category
This displays the number of spending for each category and allow us to create, read, update and delete our spending data.
4. Monthly spending report
This displays a line chart of our spending trend in this month.
5. Budget setting
This allows the user to set a budge and set up mysql configuration.
6. Data backup
This allows the user to backup the data in the database.
7. Data recovery
This allows the user to recover the database.
